## 🧭 What This Is

This is a guided tutorial for designers, creatives, and communicators to learn **React + Tailwind**. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework that helps you quickly style and build responsive sites and applications. 

You'll start with a visual design, move into hands-on coding, and finish by publishing your site online.

>You may be wondering, why **React and Tailwind**? React is one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries today, known for its popularity on GitHub and StackOverflow. Its component-based architecture allows us t break the User Interface (UI) into isolated chunks, which makes our code easier to organize and manage.
>  
>Tailwind isn't actually the most popular at the time of this writing, but its Utility First methodology allows us to style our pages or apps using small, reusable classes.  The goal of this tutorial is to get you familiar with the process of taking a design and rapidly building it out. The combination of **React and Tailwind** are a good start. If you're curious, Bootstrap is the most popular CSS framework presently.
>
> Perhaps future versions of this tutorial will be written using different JavaScript libraries and CSS frameworks.
